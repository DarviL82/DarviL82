There's a bio under my profile picture, not sure if I should put that here instead.
I guess it would be a better idea now that I think about it, since we now have the ability to place anything we want in our profile READMEs.
But it also looks great there... You know what? I will leave it there for a while. Oh yeah hello, my name is David and I don't really have a lot to say.

Alright great, but now look at this images, don't they look cool on a GitHub profile? People seems to like them.
